1. Project Overview
I create an interactive quiz game that challenges the player to answer a series of multiple-choice questions. If all questions are answered correctly, the player becomes a “Millionaire.”
This app is built entirely using Jetpack Compose** and Kotlin with multiple activities for each question. Each screen follows a consistent theme and color scheme for a smooth and engaging user experience.

2. App Features

Main Features

Splash Screen:
 The app begins with a splash screen that displays the app logo, title, and a “Start Quiz” button.
 The logo is shown inside a Card with rounded corners and elevation for a modern look.

Quiz Questions:
  The quiz contains 10 multiple-choice question each on its own activity (e.g`Question1Screen`, `Question2Screen`, etc.).
  Each question includes:

  A question prompt
  Four possible answers (A–D)
  Toast messages for correct or incorrect answers
  Automatic navigation to the next question or to the lose screen

Win & Lose Screens:

Win Screen:Displays “Congratulations! You are a Millionaire!” with a green background and “Play Again” button.
Lose Screen: Displays “Sorry, you lost! Try Again. with a red background and “Try Again” button to restart.

Toast Confirmation:
Each answer selection triggers a Toast message confirming whether the answer is correct or wrong.
